# OneMap API Repo

## Project Title: Data Extraction with API - HDB Block Coordinates and Travel Distances between Blocks (OneMap API)

Hi there. In this repo, I will be sharing how I leveraged the OneMap API to extract data relating to selected Singapore location postal codes, latitude-longitude coordinates and travel distance and time (both walking and public transport route types). Please feel free to share with me your comments, feedback and suggestions!
